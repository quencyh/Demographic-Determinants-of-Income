# Demographic-Determinants-of-Income

**Using SQL & Machine Learning to Predict Income Based on Demographics**  

This project explores how **education, age, work hours, and occupation** influence income using:  
- **SQL (SQLite3)** for database management & querying  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for data analysis & visualization  
- **Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)** for income prediction  


## 🔍 Dataset Overview
The dataset is sourced from the **UCI Adult Census Dataset** and includes:
- **48,842 records**
- **Features:** Age, Workclass, Education, Marital Status, Occupation, Race, Sex, Hours-per-week, Income
- **Target Variable:** Income (`<=50K` or `>50K`)

- ## 📊 Key Findings & Visualizations
### 📌 Income Distribution by Education
Higher education levels correlate with higher income.

### 📌 Work Hours vs Income
More hours worked per week **slightly increases** income but not linearly.

### 📌 Age Distribution of High-Income Earners
